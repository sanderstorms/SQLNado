This is a one .cs file only version of SqlNado, so you can can embark it in all your projects in a static manner without having to reference any dll.

The amalgamation contains everything an application needs to embed SQLNado. Combining all the code for SQLNado into one big file makes it easier to deploy â€” there is just one file to keep track of.

Note on Windows, you will still need the native Dlls sqlite dll. sqlite3.x64.dll and/or sqlite3.x86.dll, or Windows winsqlite3.dll around. On Linux you need a libsqlite3.so or similar around.
